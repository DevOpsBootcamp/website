Lesson 4: Security
==================

What is security?
-----------------

se·cu·ri·ty

  siˈkyo͝oritē/

  noun

  - the state of being free from danger or threat.
  - the safety of a state or organization against criminal activity such as
    terrorism, theft, or espionage.

Types of security
-----------------

* Physical security
* Software security
* Network security
    * Active vs. passive

:Authorization: Are they allowed access here?

:Identity: How do you identify a person? What makes you *you*?

Huh?
----

You can see how your connection is being encrypted pretty easily, 
including which certificate authority and protocols are being used.

Go to https://github.com and click on the little lock next to the
url.

Then click 'More information'. Under 'Verified by', you can see the
certificate authority, and under 'Technical Details' you can see 
the encryption scheme used.

What attacks are out there?

* Version-Based
* Configuration-Based

Problems with Design and Implementation
---------------------------------------

  * Authentication and Authorization
  * Session Management
  * Information Leakage
  * Unauthorized Directory Access

- Social engineering

  - Pretexting
  - Phishing
  - Baiting
  - Quid Pro Quo
  - Tailgaiting
- Zero-Day vulnerabilities

What to do if you discover a vulnerability
------------------------------------------

* First, test and document to verify that it exists.
* Then, disclose it *privately* to those responsible for fixing it
* Provide examples -- it's basically a bug report, but through private channels
  (not public tracker yet!)
* Give them time to release a patch before announcing it
* Some places have bug bounties

Ok, so should I worry?
----------------------

- Probably not
- It's all about the tools
