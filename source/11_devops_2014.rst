Devops Introduction
-------------------

What is it?

  *"A software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and
  integration between software developers and information technology (IT)
  operations professionals."* [Wikipedia]

.. [Wikipedia] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps

Definition of Devops
--------------------

- Software Engineering (Dev)
- Technology Operations (Ops)
- Quality Assurance (QA)

The old view
------------

:"Dev": side being the *"makers"*
:"Ops":
  side being the *"people that deal with the creation after its birth”*

This siloed environment has created much harm in the industry and the core
reason behind creating Devops.

**Burn down those silos!**

History of Devops
-----------------

- mid-2000s

    "*Hey, our methodology of running systems seems to still be in a pretty
    primitive state despite years of effort.  Let’s start talking about doing it
    better"*

- Velocity Conf 2008/2009 - increased presentations on *"Agile System
  Administration*"
- Agile 2008 Conf - "Agile Infrastructure" BOF -- nobody showed up!
- 2009 DevOpsDays in Ghent, Belgium - Patrick Debois

The Agile Approach
------------------

- Iterative, incremental
- Requirements change often thus need to be adaptive
- Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle
- Quality focus

Manifesto:

- *Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
- *Working software over comprehensive documentation*
- *Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
- *Responding to change over following a plan*

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on
the left more.*

Adapting Agile to Ops
---------------------

- Widening the principles towards infrastructure

  *"Infrastructure as code"* - i.e. configuration management

- Integrating ops with dev, QA and product in the product teams
- Continuous Integration

  *"Give your developers a pager and put them on call"*

- Utilizing more specific metric and monitoring schemes

Better Tools enable Devops
--------------------------

Explosion of new tools over the past few years:

  - Release tools (jenkins, travisci, etc)
  - Config Management (puppet, chef, ansible, cfengine)
  - Orchestration (zookeeper, noah, mesos)
  - Monitoring & Metrics (statsd, graphite, etc)
  - Virtualization & containerization (AWS, Openstack, vagrant, docker)

It's not NoOps
--------------

- Existing ops principles, processes and practices have not kept pace
- Business & dev teams need more agility to keep up with competitors
- Deep dev skill set + Deep ops skill set == awesomesauce
- Ops people need to do a little dev
- Dev people need to do a little ops

Configuration Management
------------------------

What is it?

    *"Configuration management is the process of standardizing resource
    configurations and enforcing their state across IT infrastructure in an
    automated yet agile manner."* `PuppetLabs`_

.. _PuppetLabs: http://puppetlabs.com/solutions/configuration-management

History of CM
-------------

- mid-1990s -- "snowflake system"; few systems
- Rise of Unix-like systems and commodity x86 hardware increased the need
- CFEngine -- First release 1993; v2 released in 2002
- mid-2000s through present

  - More agile CM systems emerged developed with the cloud in mind
- 2008

  - provisioning and management of individual systems were well-understood

Infrastructure as code
----------------------

- CM enables ops to define their infrastructure in *code*
- Install packages, configure software, start/stop services
- Ensure a state of a machine
- Ensure policies and standards are in place
- Provide history of changes for a system
- Repeatable way of rebuild a system
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together

CM Platforms
------------

- CFengine

  - Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of
    computers using the client–server paradigm or stand-alone.
- Puppet

  - Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system
    configuration, distributed using the client–server paradigm.

CM Platforms (part 2)
---------------------

- Chef

  - Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby, and uses a pure
    Ruby DSL for writing configuration "recipes". Also a client-server model.

- Ansible

  - Combines multi-node deployment, ad-hoc task execution, and configuration
    management in one package. Utilizes SSH with little to no remote agents.

Puppet Example
--------------

- Install apache and start the service
- Puppet Domain Specific Language (DSL)

.. code-block:: puppet

  package { "apache":
    name    => "httpd",
    ensure  => present,
  }

  service { "apache":
    name    => "apache",
    ensure  => running,
    enable  => true,
    require => Package["apache"],
  }

Chef Example
------------

- Install apache and start the service
- Ruby code

.. code-block:: ruby

  package "apache" do
    package_name "httpd"
    action :install
  end

  service "apache" do
    action [:enable, :start]
  end

CM Platform Comparison
----------------------

- CFEngine scales like mad, not very agile
- Puppet

  - Uses a list of dependencies and figures out what order to run it in
  - The Puppet DSL can become a blocker and a problem, puppet also has scaling
    issues
- Chef

  - Executes commands and scripts as they are listed with minimal amount of
    dependencies
  - Using ruby offers both its advantages and disadvantages
- Each platform offers its own level of complexity

    Mary,

    You'll have to contact Sharon Negative (snegative@cruftware.com), our DBA, and
    file a ticket to get the database access. She won't be back from vacation for
    another 2 weeks so it might take awhile.

    14:03 < JnomiS> AdaOpdev: hey, all the systemview tests are passing on
                    python 3.4
    14:04 <@AdaOpdev> yay! I'll spin up a VM on the cluster with the production
                      cookbook
    14:04 < JnomiS> that'll be at sysview23dev.internal.ourcorp, right?
    14:05 <@AdaOpdev> actually we're migrating over to a new test cluster
    14:05 <@AdaOpdev> could you use sysview23.dev.ourcorp instead?
    14:06 < JnomiS> sure
    14:06 <@AdaOpdev> it's set up for passwordless ssh login with your ldap
                      account
    14:07 < JnomiS> ok, awesome.
    14:07 < JnomiS> thanks!

IRC #2

.. rst-class:: codeblock-sm

.. code-block:: irc

    15:12 < JnomiS> hmm, I've been building mysql-python for the app with the
                    mysql dev libraries, but it doesn't look like you have
                    those in production
    15:22 < JnomiS> also, what database should i connect to from the dev
                    instance? I've been using MySql 5.7 in testing
    15:25 <@AdaOpdev> just get me a list of the names and databases you'll
                      need, and I'll plug them into our MySql Chef cookbooks.
    15:25 <@AdaOpdev> I checked the ORM docs, and you're not actually using any
                      features that changed between MySql 5.5 (which is what
                      we've got in production right now) and 5.7
    15:26 < JnomiS> okay, I'll run the tests with mysql5.5
    15:27 < JnomiS> everything seems to be working fine locally

IRC #3
--------

.. rst-class:: codeblock-sm

.. code-block:: irc

    16:00 < JnomiS> ugh, I totally forgot -- I'll need to get root on the dev vm
                    so I can install uwsgi and nginx
    16:00 <@AdaOpdev> We actually manage UWsgi and Nginx through chef as well.
                      Have you written cookbooks before?
    16:02 < JnomiS> nope, I've always just used yours :)
    16:05 <@AdaOpdev> http://reiddraper.com/first-chef-recipe/ and
                      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-create-simple-chef-cookbooks-to-manage-infrastructure-on-ubuntu
                      are a couple of good places to start
    16:05 < JnomiS> thanks!

.. code-block:: irc

    16:52 < JnomiS> do we have jenkins deployed anywhere yet?
    16:53 < JnomiS> I'd like to get continuous integration set up
    16:54 <@AdaOpdev> I've heard of Jenkins but not worked with it much
    16:54 < JnomiS> yeah, it'll automate that deploy hook mess we used to have
    16:54 <@AdaOpdev> cool!
    16:55 <@AdaOpdev> let's talk to our boss about getting an instance
                      provisioned
    16:55 < JnomiS> okay, I'll email him about it and cc you
    16:57 <@AdaOpdev> thanks
    16:57 <@AdaOpdev> for now let's keep using Chef for everything we can
    16:58 < JnomiS> okay, sounds good.

Non-DevOps
----------

* Poor communication, territorialism (silos)
* Development environment wildly different from production
* Sysadmin averse to changes because environment is hard to test
* Little willingness to cooperate or educate (trust/teamwork)
* It can get even worse
    * More people in email thread = more confusion
    * Bikeshedding about top post vs bottom post
    * Mary is surprisingly clear about her exact requirements

DevOps
------

* Developer tests on VM with same config as production
* Realistic expectations about access and compatibility
* More automation, configuration management
* Sysadmin can debug the code and help developer
* Developer and sysadmin help and educate one another (Chef, Jenkins)
* Distributed tasks mean fewer choke points (single person who can block task)
