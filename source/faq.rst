Email questions to devopsbootcamp@osuosl.org if they aren't answered here!

Is this a for-credit class?
---------------------------

No, although the curriculum is based on `CS312`_, Linux System Administration,
which hasn't been offered for several years.

What does it cost? 
------------------

Financially, it's free. However, to benefit from the hands-on learning
opportunities that we'll be offering, you should plan to commit 5 or more
hours per week to attending lectures and playing with the tools and
technologies that the lectures will discuss. 

I don't know about computers! Can I still join?
-----------------------------------------------

YES! If you already knew all this stuff, you'd be teaching rather than
studying it. If you think you don't know enough, try anyways -- in the worst
case you'll discover that your self-assessment was correct, and in the best
case, you'll become a successful open source contributor. 

When will meetings be? 
----------------------

Weekday evenings, probably Thursday or Friday. It depends on when the people
taking the course are available. Use the `signup form`_ to indicate your
availability.

I have a question?
------------------

Ask it. On IRC if you have that set up, or email devopsbootcamp@osuosl.org or
the mailing list.
