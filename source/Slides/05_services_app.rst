Lesson 5: Web Applications
==========================

What is a web app?
------------------

.. note::
    - talk briefly about responsibilities of each component
    - talk briefly about http
    - mention Virtual Environments (red box on diagram)

What is this Virtual Environment thing?
---------------------------------------

.. note:: Discuss system packages vs local, mention rvm

* Separates application packages from system packages
* Choose versions that differ from the system versions
* Maintain a list of required packages for easy install
* Install modules as a user
* Pip and Gem


Frameworks
----------

Ready-made building blocks take care of the tedious details:

* Speaking HTTP
* Connecting code to URLS
* Talking to the database
* Built-in development servers
  
Popular frameworks:

Django, CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, Flask

.. note::
  Talk about major differences between frameworks, especially Django and Flask


The SystemView app
------------------

Display a filtered list of processes on the system

    :align: center

.. note::
  - explain basic idea of the app
	- reference code from lesson 4


Setting Up
----------

Update your vagrant file and vagrant up:

.. code-block:: bash

	git pull
	vagrant up
	vagrant ssh

.. note:: Changes to the vagrant file: forward port 5050 to 5000 on the vm

    
Setting Up
----------

Install packages

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo yum install python-virtualenv*
	sudo yum install git

Create a virtualenv

.. code-block:: bash

	virtualenv systemview_venv

And activate it

.. code-block:: bash

	source systemview_venv/bin/activate

.. note::

  - students probably already have git?
  - discuss what virtualenv actually does, what is in it
  - env variables, etc
  - they can put the virtualenv anywhere, discuss locations
  - discuss, but don't use virtualenv tools (mkvirtualenv, use, etc)
  - explain what source does


Get the Code
------------

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone git@github.com:DevOpsBootcamp/systemview.git


.. note::
  - break here for github account setup, key location (where are they checking
    code out from? Where is their key located?), etc
  - https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/systemview.git for anyone who can't get
    their account/key working

Run the Code
------------

.. code-block:: bash

	cd systemview
	python systemview.py 

Fail
----

Oops!

::

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "systemview.py", line 2, in <module>
	    from flask import Flask, request, session, g, redirect, url_for, \
	ImportError: No module named flask

.. note:: talk about missing modules, we need to install them, this is
	what the venv is for

Pip
---

A package manager for Python packages

* Connects to PyPi, a vast repository of Python modules
* Resolves dependencies, installs prerequisites
* Can install packages from a list in a file


Install What's Missing
----------------------

Make sure you are in your virtualenv, then:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	pip install flask
	pip install argparse

.. note::
  - How do you know if you are in the virtualenv?
  - can put requirements in requirements.txt for easy installation

Run and Test!
-------------

.. code-block:: bash
	
	python systemview.py -i 0.0.0.0 -d

Now go to http://localhost:5050

.. note::
  - talk about flags 
  - go to terminal after this slide and talk about the code:

    - main module, templates, css, etc
  - Point out areas where bugs could be fixed or features added

Branch and Modify
-----------------

Create a Github issue for your changes

https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/systemview/issues

Create a branch for your changes

.. code-block:: bash

	git checkout -b my_name

When you have made changes and everything works, push it up

.. code-block:: bash

	git push origin my_name

.. note::

  - talk about branching vs forking, get everyone working on a new feature or
    bug
  - use IRC handles for branch names to make sure you are unique and
    identifiable

Homework
--------

Add a feature or fix a bug, push your changes up.
