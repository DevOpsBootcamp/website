Configuration Management
------------------------

    “Configuration management is the process of standardizing resource
    configurations and enforcing their state across IT infrastructure in an
    automated yet agile manner.”

    - Puppet Labs

.. ifnotslides::

    In short, Configuration Management is the concept of turning your server
    infrastructure into code.

    Setting up a server manually is cumbersome.  Installing your operating
    system, setting up users, copying files, installing packages, and all the
    other things you need to do to get a server up and running takes time and
    resources.  An alternative that has become popular in the past decade is
    writing code that allows you to state what you want to happen.  The
    infrastructure-as-code is written once and can be run on hundreds of
    thousands of servers and each machine will be setup exactly as the same as
    all the others.

    }


Short History of CM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    In the beginning there were no computers.

    Then many years passed and eventually we built the first computer.

    Then a few years after that we had more computers than we really had time
    to manage.  Things got out of hand pretty quick.

    Eventually system administrators were manually managing dozens, or even
    hundreds, of computers.  When a computer is manually managed it's called a
    *Special Snowflake*.  Specal Snowflakes are setup manually and are very
    fragile.  Unfortunatly companies like Facebook and Google can't scale
    *Special Snowflakes* quickly and easliy, so they had to figure out a
    better solution.

    The answer was Configuration Management.  The earliest incarnations were
    **shell scripts** that you would run on a server, but those weren't
    perfect and required re-inventing the wheel quite a bit.  Eventually more
    standardized tools were created to solve this *Special Snowflake* problem
    in a way that scaled faster, iterated quicker, and worked more dependably.


Concept: Infrastructure as Code
-------------------------------

    Infrastructure as code is the act of describing what you want your servers
    to look like *once*, and using that to *provision* many machines to look
    the same.

    It turns *pets* into *cattle*. (more on this difference later)

.. ifnotslides::

    That is how the paradigm is usually put.  Pets (or *Special Snowflakes*)
    are servers you manage by hand and care very much about.  If a Pet dies it
    takes a while to get over, while you can get a new Pet it won't be the
    same and will take a while to potty-train.

    A Cattle is not important on it's own, all you care about is the herd.  If
    one cattle dies you've got dozens more -- you've still got a herd.
    Infrastructure as code allows you to treat servers like cattle instead of
    pets.

    Provsioning is running your CM code that tells the server what to install
    and which files to write, automatically doing what you would usually do
    manually.  This is much faster than a person doing it and is less error
    prone.


- CM enables System Operation to define their infrastructure in code.
- Install packages, configure software, start/stop services.
- Ensure/guarantee a specific state of a machine.
- Provide history of changes for a system.
- Repeatable way of rebuilding a system.
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together.


Pull vs Push Models
-------------------

.. ifnotslides::

    Configuration Management tools tend to implement one (or both) of these
    models of management.  These are the *ways* a given configuration
    management tool actually *does the things* it has to do, like installing
    packages and writing files.

Pull Model
    - When the server being provisioned (node) runs an agent (daemon) that
      asks a central authority (master) if/when it has any updates that it
      should run.

    - Requires a daemon to be installed on all machines *and* a central
      authority to be setup.

    - Scales well, difficult to manage.

Push Model
    - A central server contacts the nodes and sends updates as they are needed.

    - When a change is made to the infrastructure (code) each node is alerted
      of this and they run the changes.

    - Simple to manage and setup (usually uses prevalent SSH protocol), not
      scalable.


Tools

    :alt: Puppet Logo

.. ifnotslides::

    Puppet (the software and company) has been around since 2005!  It's used
    by huge customers like WalMart and is known for it's stability.

- Uses custom CM Language.
- Primary Push Model.
- Widely Adopted.
- Very stable.
- Difficult to get setup.

Chef
~~~~

.. image:: /static/logo_chef.png

    :alt: Chef Logo

.. ifnotslides::

    Chef has been around since 2009 and is most known for being configured via
    the Ruby programming language.  It has a very similar feature-set to
    Puppet.

- Primarily Push Model.
- Code files are Ruby.
- Widely Adopted.
- Difficult to setup.

CFEngine
~~~~~~~~

    :alt: Ansible logo
    :align: center

.. ifnotslides::

    CFEngine is a very old configuration management software (started in
    1993!) and is best known for being exceptionally fast and stable, but
    difficult to change / adapt quickly.

- Fast at execution, slow at adaptation.
- Very old.
- Stable.

Ansible
~~~~~~~

.. image:: /static/logo_ansible.png
    :alt: Ansible logo
    :align: right

.. ifnotslides::

    Ansible is notorously easy to setup and use.  It does not use a
    programming language to describe the state of software but declares the
    state of a machine with the ``yaml`` markup language.

- Easy to use.
- Easy to setup.
- Does not scale well.

Delcaration Configuration
-------------------------

.. ifnotslides::

    Declaration Configuration is the concept of declaring the state a machine
    *ought* to be in and letting the configuration management reach that state
    however it feels is appropriate.  This is advantageous because it can
    short-circut a process by checking if it is already in that state before
    attempting to install/copy/configure a part of the system.

    Here is some Declaration Configuration pseudo-code:

::

    packages [nginx, python, vim]
        state installed
        update true

    service nginx
        state enabled
        alert service myapp_daemon

.. ifnotslides::

    In this case we used declaration configuration to install a list of
    packages and keep them updated.  We also enabled a service so ``nginx``
    will be run when the machine is turned on.  Lastly we told our
    pseudo-configuration-management to alert another service.  This means that
    there is a block somewhere else in the code for ``service myapp_daemon``
    which will always get run when the ``service nginx`` block gets run.


Chef Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Install apache and start the service
- Configuration is called a ‘recipe’
- Written as pure Ruby code

.. code-block:: ruby

    package "apache" do
      package_name "httpd"
      action :install
    end

    service "apache" do
      action [:enable, :start]
    end

.. note::

    Since chef uses Ruby you can do loops and other cool Ruby-isms in your
    configuration management.  This can be a gift and a curse.


Puppet Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Install apache and start the service
- Configuration is called a ‘manifest’
- Puppet DSL based on Ruby

::

    package { "apache":
      name    => "httpd",
      ensure  => present,
    }

    service { "apache":
      name    => "apache",
      ensure  => running,
      enable  => true,
      require => Package["apache"],
    }

.. note::

    Since Puppet designed it's own language for Configuration managent you are
    more limited in what you can express with Puppet, but this isn't always a
    bad thing.  It's feature rich and can do pretty much anything Chef can.


Ansible Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Install apache and start the service
- Configuration is called a ‘playbook’
- Uses YAML file format for configuration

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: all
      tasks:

        - name: Install Apache
          yum:
            name: httpd
            state: present

        - name: Start Apache Service
          service:
            name: httpd
            state: running
            enabled: yes

.. note::

    Ansible's *langauge* is Yaml, which is basically JSON but easier to read
    and write.  This is similar to Puppet in it limits the possible
    functionality, but again: these tools all achieve the same result, they
    just get there in different ways.


TODO: Use Ansible to Provision ``localhost``
--------------------------------------------

.. ifnotslides::

    If you want to learn the *principles* of configuration management then
    Ansible is a good tool to start with.  There are very few moving parts so
    you can learn how to use it in a few hours.

    To start we're going to install Ansible with ``pip``.

::

    $ pip install ansible

.. TODO: Finish an activity.
