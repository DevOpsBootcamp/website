Application Isolation
---------------------

.. ifslides::

    **The seperation of one program or application stack from others.**

    **The oldest way to do this is to run your application on a
    separate computer, but that gets very expensive very quickly.**

    Application isolation is the separation of one program or application stack
    from others.  The oldest way to do this is to run your application on a
    separate computer, but that gets very expensive very quickly.

    There are two main ways to tackle Application Isolation on one computer:
    Virtual Machines and Containers.  They both achieve similar end results
    but achieve that end in differnt ways and offer different advantages /
    disadvantages.

    Virtual Machines are programs running on your operating system which
    emulate the entire computer and operating system.  This is good because it
    completely isolates the programs running on the VM from the host
    operating system, but that advantage is also a problem.

    The core disadvantage of a VM is that it is resoruce intensive.  There is a
    lot of overhead in emulating an Operating System.  While it offers
    complete and thorough isolation, that comes at a cost.

    Here is a demonstration showing the processes inside of a VM versus a host
    OS

::

    [vm] # ps aux
    USER PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root   1  0.0  0.6 110564  3164 ?   Ss    2015  11:17 /lib/systemd/systemd --system --deserialize 15
    root   2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S     2015   0:00 [kthreadd]
    root   3  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S     2015   3:55 [ksoftirqd/0]
    root   5  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S<    2015   0:00 [kworker/0:0H]

::

    [host] # ps aux
    USER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root    1  0.0  0.1 200328  5208 ?   Ss   Aug25   0:44 /sbin/init
    root    2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S    Aug25   0:00 [kthreadd]
    root    3  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S    Aug25   0:05 [ksoftirqd/0]
    root    5  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?   S<   Aug25   0:00 [kworker/0:0H]
    [... 240+ more lines ...]


OS Emulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    Let's talk about that emulation problem.  Imagine you are running a
    computer that has an X86_64 CPU on it.  You want to emulate a computer
    with an ARM5 CPU.  The emulated operating system makes system calls to the
    *'hardware'* it thinks it is running on.  The host operating system
    translates those system calls into *real* system calls on the *actual*
    hardware.  This translation is cost intensive and usually slow, but it's
    gotten a lot better over the decades.  When emulating a separate CPU
    architecture, optimizations usually have to be made for the emulated OS to
    be usable.

    **Note:** When you are emulating an X86_64 VM on an X86_64 piece of
    hardware, an optimization that can be made in which the host OS passes the
    system calls directly to the hardware without having to *translate*
    anything.  This is done by a *hypervisor* which enforces certain security
    protocols so the two operating systems (host and guest) are still isolated,
    but things go much faster.


Containers
----------

.. ifnotslides::

    Containers approach application isolation from a different angle.  Instead
    of emulating an entire operating system they use the same host kernel
    (operating system) to run the guest operating system.  This entirely
    by-passes the emulation problem.  Containers isolate applicatiosn using
    two technologies on Linux: CGroups and Systemd.  Together these isolate
    the guest OS' processes from the host, and limit the guest's resources
    respectively.

    Instead of emulating the guest OS containers use the host kernel and
    *lie* to the guest process and tell it that it's the only application
    running on that OS.  Containers avoid the emulation problem by not using a
    hypervisor and instead using a combination of technologies to get the same
    job done.

    Containers have very become popular recently, but their underlying
    technologies aren't new.  Many application developers and system
    administrators have begun migrating toward using Containers over VMs as
    they tend to be more performant, but the industry as a whole is waiting
    for them to get a bit more battle-tested.

    Here is the previous demonstration in a container:

::

    $ ps aux  # Lists all processes running on an OS
    PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
    1 root       0:00 sh
    6 root       0:00 ps aux

.. ifnotslides::

    As you can see, instead of emulating an entire OS (running 100+
    processes), the container is told that it's processes (``sh`` and ``ps``
    in this case) are the only one in this environment.  In theory this
    prevents a malicious attack from inside the container from invading the
    host OS.


Not a Virtual Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    One key thing to remember is that **a container is not a virtual
    machine**.  It may act like a VM, and isolate like a VM, but they're
    different and for now they are not 100% interchangeable.

    :alt: Diagram of Containers vs Virtual Machines


CGroups + Systemd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    CGroups and Systemd are the two technologies that allow Containers to
    exist.

    CGruops
        A linux kernel-level technology that name-spaces processes.  It
        basically allows a host OS to convince a process running on it that it
        is running in it's own environment.  This is what isolates a process
        from other processes, if they think they're the only thing running they
        can't tamper with the host OS.

    Systemd
        The service manager for most Linux distributions.  Systemd starts
        services like Apache, but can also limit an application's resoruces.
        This allows you to limit a container from using all of your computer's
        resources, a common paradigm in VM management.


Pros
----

.. TODO: Flesh this section out a bit

======================================= =======================================
**Virtual Machines**                    **Containers**
--------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
Complete process isolation              Fast startup
'Battle Tested'                         Little overhead
======================================= =======================================


Cons
----

======================================= =======================================
**Virtual Machines**                    **Containers**
--------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
Slightly more overhead.                 Security concerns.
Slow startup.                           No cross-kernel emulation.
Cross-OS emulation.
======================================= =======================================

.. ifnotslides::

    Many of these concerns are temporary or negligible.  For instance, many
    organizations that run virtual machines aren't concerned with startup
    times.  And security concerns are a temporary issue in that the industry
    is already developing solutions for the existing security problems with
    containers.

    One thing that we haven't touched on is the **No cross-kernel emulation**
    for containers.  One advantage to Virtual Machines is that a Windows OS
    can emulate Linux, and vice-verse.  Unfortunately it's not the same with
    containers: A Linux OS can only (natively) run a Linux container, and
    Windows can only containerize Windows.  The industry solution to this
    problem is to run a container in a small VM.


Tools
-----

.. ifnotslides::

    There are a mutlitude of tools for using and managing VMs and Containers.

======================================= =======================================
**Virtual Machines**                    **Containers**
--------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
VirtualBox                              Docker
VMWare                                  Rkt
======================================= =======================================


Virtual Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    There are a lot of tools for managing Virtual Machines in many
    different ways.

VirtualBox
    An Open Source VM Manager.

    Widely used and supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

VMWare
    A closed source VM Manager.

    VMWare is a widely used and tends to have better performance than Virtual
    Box.  While it can emulate Linux it does not work natively on Linux.

KVM
    The Kernel-based Virtual Machine.

    Linux's native infrastructure for handling Virtual Machines and emulation.
    Usually used in a larger emulation program, not alone.


Containers
~~~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    Containers have only recently gained popularity, but there are also many
    tools avaliable for container management.

Docker
    The defacto CLI tool for creating and using containers.

    Very popular and well integrated into other tools.

RKT
    A competitor to Docker created by CoreOS.  Approaches container management
    from a different angle which has it's advantages and disadvantages.

``chroot``
    The *oldschool* way to use containers.  Not a container in the modern
    sense, but achieves similar isolation.

Jails
    The BSD Unix form of containerization.  Offers a level of secure isolation
    not really possible in Linux.
