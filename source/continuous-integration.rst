Continuous Integration

    Continuous Integration is using an automated system, integrated as
    seamlessly into your toolchain as possible,  to do the following:

    #. Detect changes to your project.
    #. Run your automated test suite on the changed code.
    #. Alerts the people that care if something good/bad happened.

    CI tools are also known to do a slew of other things:

    - Build and release new versions of a package when they're needed.
    - Build documentation and other parts of a project automatically.


Automated Testing
-----------------

    Automated testing is the most common, and easiest to setup, CI tool.

    It detects through Git, or whatever SVC tool you use, a change to your
    codebase (new Pull Request, new branch, new commit on master/develop,
    etc), and runs your tests automatically.  If it finds a problem it sends
    an email and places a red ``x`` somewhere prominent so people know the it
    isn't passing the tests yet.  If it's good there will be a little green
    ``âœ”``.


Tool: Travis CI
---------------

    Travis CI is very popular among Github users because it is easy to setup
    with Github projects and integrates well with Github workflows.  It's
    also free for Open Source projects, although the service itself is not
    Open Source.

Runs test suites for:

- C / C++
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- Ruby
- *Many* more on `the Travis CI docs`_!

Tool: Jenkins
-------------

.. ifnotslides::

    Jenkins is a more powerful version of Travis, but as a result is more
    complicated to use and setup.  While you can pay to use a public instance
    of Jenkins, it is common to run your own instance of Jenkins.

- Does pretty much anything you can tell a computer to do, automatically.
- Builds and uploads binaries (releases).
- Runs tests.
- Reports build successes/failures.
- Also has plugins!

TODO: Setup Travis on a GH Repo
-------------------------------

.. TODO: Add an activity.

.. Something like: Fork a devopsbootcamp repo, setup traivs on it, check your
.. status, etc.
.. I suggest building off of whatever project that was done in the 'testing'
.. lesson.


Further Reading
---------------

`Jenkins Documentation`_
    The Jenkins project documentation.  If you need a broad overview read the
    *Getting Started with...* docs.

`TravisCI Documentation`_
    If you end up working on a large project on GitHub you're going to
    interface with TravisCI sooner or later.

`CircleCI Documentation`_
    CircleCI is a tool we didn't get to touch on.  It is very similar to
    Travis.
