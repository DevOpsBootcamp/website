*DevOps*
~~~~~~~~

.. ifnotslides::

    DevOps can mean a lot of thing to a lot of people, and in the grand scheme
    of *Computer Science* it's a relatively new term.  One definition you can
    always get a way with is this:

.. highlights::

    **DevOps** is a field which takes skills from **Software Development** and
    **Operations Engineering** to create and run applications more
    effectively.

    TLDR: Development + Operations == Better Services

.. ifnotslides::

    In a pre-DevOps world the jobs of Devs and Ops were seperate:
        - There was a clearly defined and relatively standardized interface
          between the two.
        - Workflows were slower, meaning ther was more time to troubleshoot and
          debug.

    In a Post-DevOps world we have a new hybrid job:
        - Software is released faster via **Agile Development**.
        - Larger scale services means companies need many identical servers,
          spawning **Configuration Management** tools.
        - Devs need to know ops skills to better tests their projects and to
          anticipate issues when it comes to deploying the application.
        - Ops need to know development skills to minimize wasted resources and
          to improve security of the applications and the servers those apps
          run on.


What *DevOps BootCamp* (DOBC) is
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **TLDR: Couch to DevOps in 1 school year**

DOBC is a free education program offering:
    - **Mentors** teaching DevOps related tools and concepts.
    - **A challenge** for anybody willing to put in the effort.
    - One-on-one **Apprenticeship**.
    - **Hands-on** training and lectures
    - **Free and Open Source course** materials!

.. ifnotslides::

    **DOBC will meet about twice monthly** for in-person lectures and hands-on
    activities.  **All course materials are avaliable from the start** for
    those who are self-guided and want to work ahead.

    Check the schedule for more information.


What DOBC is *not*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DevOps BootCamp is not:
    - A for-credit OSU class
    - A Student job
    - Easy

.. ifnotslides::

    DOBC is a free course for all types of students. If you want to attend
    online, in person, or just want help on IRC you are welcomed and encouraged
    to participate.

    While the course does not go on your academic transcript, the skills you
    learn and the course itself can (and should) go on you Resume.  The many
    benefits of DOBC will be discussed and brought up throughout the course.


Why DOBC Exists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DOBC was created because the OSU OSL:
    #. **Merged** with the school of **EECS**.
    #. Wanted to help students **meet Company demands and expectations** of
       recent graduates.
    #. Needed to **bridge the “Skills Gap”** of the OSU EECS curriculum.
    #. Wanted to build a **DevOps Learning community**.

.. ifnotslides::

    The OSU Open Source Lab has become part of the OSU School of EECS so this
    program was created in an effort to contribute *directly* to the learning
    community by sharing our knowledge in a useful and constructive way.

    In teaching OSU Students (and anybody else who wants to learn) we hope to
    give more people a chance reach employment in the growing and exciting
    industries around DevOps.


What You Will do
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will Learn:
    - Linux systems
    - Networking
    - Software development
    - Tools and why they matter

.. ifnotslides::

    DOBC focuses on teaching conceptual understanding over wrought memorization
    of commands to get a particular job done. This means that we will be
    addressing the why and what am I doing much more often than the how and
    what do I type.

You will build:
    - Functioning applications on the cloud
    - Cloud infrastructures

.. ifnotslides::

    The tools of industry change every year, but the way we tackle problems
    changes much more slowly. DOBC focuses on learning **how** and **why** in
    problem solving over the **what**.  That doesn't mean we won't mess with
    code and servers, it just means we'll talk about what and why we're doing
    something too!


Who Teaches DOBC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The teachers of DOBC include:
    - OSL Students
    - OSL Faculty
    - Guests from *The Industry*
    - You!

.. ifnotslides::

    The OSL employs ~20 part-time students who are all equipped to answer
    questions and teach this course. Many of your lecturers and activity
    assistants were once DOBC students and are now gainfully employed by the
    OSL.

    We also bring in guest speakers in from time-to-time to talk about a
    specific topic. These guest lectures may not be as interactive as other
    lessons, but meeting and talking with industry experts is a valuable
    experience you should take.

    We also encourage asking questions and students contributing to the course.
    If you learned something interesting share it with your peers and during
    class. At the very least ask questions; you’re not the only one who's
    confused.


The ‘Agreement’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**You get out what you put in.**
    DOBC is not meant to be easy. Stick with it, persistence is rewarded.

**Student Benefits:**
    A free education on industry topics, tools, and concepts

**Student Responsibilities:**
    Show up if you can, keep up if you cannot, put forth effort, and don’t
    forget to have fun.

**Give us feedback.**
    - There will be a survey you, should take it.
    - Honesty is the best policy.
