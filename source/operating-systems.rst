What an Operating System is
---------------------------

    An Operating System is the software which manages physical computing
    resources, interfaces between the hardware and the applications on a
    computer, and what exposes a creates a number of APIs for giving developers
    access to low-level applications / hardware.  The OS allows application
    developers and hardware manufactures to do their jobs and not worry about
    *"How does this spinning disk affect my browser"* and *"How will this
    networking card interact with my game engine"*.


Anatomy of an OS
----------------

    :alt: How the kernel fits into the OS stack.

.. ifnotslides::

    The OS is not *always* one thing or another.  Some Operating systems are
    behemoths while others are minimal.  Some are designed for teaching
    purposes while others are optimized for managing data centers.

    The general diagram, from **you -> hardware**, looks like this:

- **User Interface:** What you interact with.  Window Managers for instance.
- **Application Layer:** What developers use to make software run.
- **Kernel:** *The Core of the OS*.  Makes communication between hardware and
  applications sane.
- **Hardware:** What does the actual computations.  The thing your keyboard is
  plugged into.

.. ifnotslides::

    The two middle parts (The Kernel and the Application Layer) of the diagram
    are often put together and called an Operating System. However, the scope
    of each layer is one of Computer Science's oldest and most contentious
    philosophical debates. *Microkernels* such as Mach and MINIX only
    implement a bare minimum interface to bridge the gap between software
    and hardware. In a Microkernel, software such as device drivers and file
    systems are separate from the kernel, and instead run in the Application
    Layer. On the other hand, *Monolithic Kernels* such as Linux include
    drivers, file systems, and other software as a part of the kernel.


Types of Operating Systems
---------------------------

.. ifnotslides::

    Most of us only interact with one or two OS's in a day: our phone OS and
    personal computer OS.  There are many other types of OS's depending on a
    variety of needs.  Scientific computing for instance has different
    requirements than a pace-maker or a GameBoy.  Each of these areas has their
    own *types* of applications they run and as a result they have specialized
    OS's to make those applications operate optimally.

    .. note::

        We list these as seperate types of OS, but rarely will an OS have
        mutually exclusive types.


    **Single/Multi-tasking**
        An OS may only need to run one task at a time while another OS needs to
        work on many tasks in parallel.

        *Ex: DOS vs Linux and moderns Windows.*

    **Single/Multi-user**
        Some OS host many users interacting with one-another.  More specialized
        OS don't need to handle that.

    **Embedded**
        A *very* simple OS capable of doing one job well. (Arduino, pace-maker,
        etc).

    **Real-time**
        For precise timing applications (e.g., life or death situations, or
        music production!).

.. ifslides::

    *Each OS is not created equal (but they're usually made to do their job
    well!)*

    - **Single/Multi-tasking**
    - **Single/Multi-user**
    - **Embedded**
    - **Real-time**


Popular Operating Systems
-------------------------

.. ifnotslides::

    There are many popular (used daily by many people) Operating Systems out
    there.  The ones listed below all get the same jobs done (browsing the web,
    editing documents, playing games, etc), but they approach the problem in a
    **technically** or **philosophically** different way.

- UNIX

  - Linux

    - Android
    - Debian
    - RHEL

  - MacOS / Darwin
  - FreeBSD

- Windows

.. ifnotslides::

    The **UNIX family** of operating systems all implement the **POSIX
    standard** OS interafces, which has been around since ~1980.  POSIX is a
    very common standard of OS design which makes it easier to write one
    program that works on different (POSIX) operating systems.  This might not
    seem like such a big deal today but it was revolutionary in the 70's and
    80's.

    This isn't to say Windows is *bad* for being different, it implements a lot
    of interesting and smart designs of it's own, and it's mostly POSIX
    compliant!


GNU/Linux
---------

    *Welcome to the Family*

.. ifnotslides::

    |

    **Linux** is the *kernel* the powers many *flavors* (or
    Distros/Distributions) of **GNU/Linux**.  Each flavor was created because
    of *philosophical*, *technical*, or *social* difference in opinions with
    the existing flavors of Linux *on the market*.

    The reason some people call it **GNU**/Linux is because the OS you use is a
    Linux *kernel* with GNU *utilities* on top of it; things like basic
    command-line tools and other software that turns a *kernel* into a
    full-fledged *OS*.  We will flip-flop between calling this OS *GNU/Linux*
    and just *Linux* throughout this course, but we mean the former unless we
    are talking about *Linux Kernel*.

    GNU/Linux runs everything from smart-phones (Android) to the International
    Space Station (Debian) and Data Centers in between.


Flavors of Linux
----------------

.. ifnotslides::

    Variants (forks) of Linux Operating Systems are called *flavors*.  These
    are grouped into *families* based on their operating system ancestry.
    `More Information`_.

- Debian
    - Ubuntu
        - LinuxMint
- RedHat
    - RHEL
    - Fedora
    - Centos
- Gentoo
    - ChromeOS
- **Slackware**
- **ArchLinux**

TODO: Pop Quiz
--------------

#. What are some different types of Operating Systems?
#. What constitutes a 'Distribution' of Linux?
#. How is Linux different from Windows? OSX?
#. How is Debian different from Gentoo?

.. ifnotslides::

    #. Single/Multi-user OS, Embedded OS, Real-time OS, Single/Multi-tasking
       OS.
    #. Distros are a version of Linux which is *distributed* to others.  Your
       personal installation, with all of it's tricked out changes, is not a
       distro, but if you were to package it into an ISO and have other people
       download it, that would be a distro.
    #. Linux is different from Windows in that it is a Unix-like OS, and Free &
       Open Source.  It is different from OSX in that it is Free & Open Source.
    #. Each distro (including Debian vs Gentoo) differ in ideology.  Gentoo
       wants to be a Linux distro that does one thing well while Debian wants
       to do something different well.  Very few distros have identical
       philosophies.

Free Online Resources:
    `OSDev.org`_  is a wiki dedicated to helping people develop their own
    operating systems.  It's a big leap from this lesson, but great if you're
    interested in learning the nitty-gritty.

    `Operating Systems Design and Implementation`_ by Andrew S. Tanenbaum is a
    classsic in the world of OS Development.  It's also a big leap, but can
    teach you more about how Operating Systems work than you ever thought there
    was to know.
