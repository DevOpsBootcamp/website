DevOps Open Office Labs
-----------------------

Following the Fall Kickoff, we will be hosting bi-weekly open office labs in Milne 224 in two hour blocks. These labs
initially will be structured around the content on the website but will aim to be mostly hands on. OSL students and
staff will be on-site to help you work through the content. Content discussed at each lab will depend on the attendees
interest. We will also be opening up our Milne server room for students to learn and interact with actual hardware.

Some interesting topics we may end up discussing include (expanded on the lessons we already have on the website):

- Automated Linux installs
- Network switch configuration
- Out of Band (IPMI) configuration and usage
- Installing servers in racks and configuring them
- Setting up servers to run various services (email, web, DNS, etc)
- Open Source software contributions

Our Milne server room includes three `OpenCompute`_ Racks donated from Facebook (includes a total of 90 compute nodes),
managed network switches, and other various rack mounted server hardware.
